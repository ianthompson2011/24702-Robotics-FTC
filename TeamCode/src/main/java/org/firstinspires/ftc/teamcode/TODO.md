<h1>TODO LIST</h1>

<p>We are currently on this <a href="https://pedropathing.com/docs/pathing/tuning/localization/pinpoint" target="_blank">segment</a> of the pedro pathing documentation</p>
<h4>Things to do for the robot:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Install ground strap to ensure the robot does not disconnect during the time where code is pushed. NOTE: the ground strap does not work for some reason, might want to get help from 506</li>
    <li>Pedro pathing: we have finished localization. However, when trying to move the robot forward, it strafes to the right. This might be an issue with <code>Constants.java</code></li>
    <li>Ensure the accuracy of shooting with <code>setVelocity</code></li>
</ul>
